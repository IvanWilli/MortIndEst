title: "Estimates for a time series of {}_{45}q_{15}"

This is a vignette about using different methods to build the time series of {}*{45}q*{15} in *ACountry*. We will apply **intercensal survival, orphanhood, widowhood and siblings** survival methods for a variety of sources distributed along 1950-2023 years, with the goal to get a smoothed series.
